  <div id="about">
    <p>My name is Martin, I'm an engineering student and software developer.</p>
    <p>I'm currently splitting my time between my work/study program at <a href="https://ece.fr" target="_blank">ECE Paris</a> and <a href="https://worldline.com" target="_blank">Worldline</a> and my own projects. I also do a small amount of selective freelance work mainly as Laravel/Vue.js developer.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m also an indie maker that built SAAS projects. My focus is currently on <a href="https://carlapp.co" target="_blank">Carl</a>.</p>
